# Sentiment-Analysis-using-R

# 📖 Kindle Reviews Sentiment Analysis using R 🔍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the sentiment of customer reviews for Kindle products using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in **R**. The aim is to understand customer emotions, extract insights from review texts, and visualize the frequency and sentiment of words.

Additionally, this project served as a **learning experience** for me to explore **text mining, sentiment analysis, and data visualization in R**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains customer reviews, including:
- **`rating`** → Numerical rating given by customers.
- **`reviewText`** → Textual review content.
- **`summary`** → Short summary of the review.

---

## 🔎 Steps in Analysis

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
Before performing sentiment analysis, the text data is cleaned and preprocessed using the `tm` package:
✔ **Converted text to lowercase**  
✔ **Removed special characters, numbers, and punctuations**  
✔ **Eliminated common stopwords** (e.g., *the, it, is, in, and*)  
✔ **Performed stemming** (reducing words to their root form)

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
To understand common themes in Kindle reviews, we analyze **word frequency and distribution**.

#### 📊 **Term Document Matrix (TDM)**
A **Term Document Matrix (TDM)** is created to quantify word occurrences. The most frequently used words are extracted and visualized.

#### 📈 **Visualizations**
- 📌 **Bar plot** → Displays the **top 5 most frequently used words**.
- 🥧 **Pie chart** → Shows the **distribution of top 5 words**.
- ☁ **Word cloud** → A visual representation of word importance based on frequency.

### **3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis**
We use the `syuzhet` package to perform **sentiment analysis** with multiple methods:

- 🟢 **Syuzhet method** → Scores sentiment on a scale of `-1` (negative) to `+1` (positive).
- 🔴 **Bing method** → Binary classification into **negative (`-1`)** and **positive (`+1`)**.
- 🟡 **Afinn method** → Scores sentiment on a scale of `-5` (very negative) to `+5` (very positive).

#### ✅ **Comparison of Sentiment Methods**
To compare accuracy and consistency, we check the **sentiment classification** across the **Syuzhet, Bing, and Afinn** methods.

### **4️⃣ Emotion Classification**
Each review is categorized into **8 emotions** using NRC lexicon-based sentiment analysis:

| Emotion | Description |
|---------|------------|
| 😡 **Anger** | Negative feelings of frustration |
| 🧐 **Anticipation** | Expecting something positive/negative |
| 🤮 **Disgust** | Strong negative reaction |
| 😨 **Fear** | Concern or apprehension |
| 😃 **Joy** | Positive feelings of happiness |
| 😢 **Sadness** | Negative feelings of sorrow |
| 😲 **Surprise** | Unexpected reaction |
| 🤝 **Trust** | Confidence in something |

### 📊 **Visualizations**
- 📌 **Bar plot** → Shows the **count of words linked to each sentiment**.
- 📊 **Percentage bar chart** → Represents the **proportion of words related to each emotion**.

---

## 🏆 Final Insights
- 📈 The **median sentiment score is positive**, suggesting **overall positive feedback** about Kindle products.
- 🔝 The most frequently used words indicate that **“book” and “story”** dominate in reviews.
- 🎉 **Joy and trust** are the most prevalent emotions, implying **customer satisfaction**.
- 📊 The **NRC method** provides a more detailed emotion analysis than binary classification.
